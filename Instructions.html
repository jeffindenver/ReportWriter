<h1>CellularOne Daily Report Step by Step Instructions</h1>


<div class="stepInstruction">
    <h2>Step 1</h2>
    <p>First, you will want to gather all the necessary files. You may download all files from
        the FTPS site using your favorite FTP program. Site: ftps.us.caas.hosted-inin.com</p>

    <h4>Required Files</h4>
    <p>Folder: ../ScheduledReports/</p>

    <ul>
        <li>CellOne_MTD_QBD.xls</li>
        <li>CellOne_Summary_MTD_QBD.xls</li>
        <li>CellOne_Summary_WTD_QBD.xls</li>
        <li>CellOne_WTD_QBD.xls</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Folder: ../ScheduledReports/Agents/</p>

    <ul style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
        <li>CellularOne Outbound MTD.xls</li>
        <li>CellularOne Outbound WTD.xls</li>
        <li>CellularOne QA MTD.xls</li>
        <li>ThisMonth_C1.xls</li>
        <li>ThisWeek_C1.xls</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="stepInstruction"><p>
    <h2>Step 2</h2>
    Second, the report requires occupancy numbers for the agents. For this, we use the
    Efficiency Reporter program located at
    <b>S:\Reports\Utilities\EfficiencyReporter\EfficiencyReporterAuto.jar</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Double click the jar file to run the program.</li>
        <li>Drag the files ThisMonth_C1.xls and ThisWeek_C1.xls onto the program window.</li>
    </ul>

    <img src="images\launcher.png" alt="Launcher" width="800">

    <p>The program will process the files and output efficiency reports, including the
        occupancy stats. The output file will be written to the same directory from which
        the files were dragged.</p>
</div>


<div class="stepInstruction">
    <h2>Step 3</h2>
    <p>Outbound calls are not included in regular agent efficiency reports. Consequently, we need to add them.
    <ul>
        <li>Open each of the output files.</li>
        <li>In the agent name column, add rows named "outbound" and "total."</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <img src="images\NewRows.PNG" alt="New Rows" width="800">
</div>


<p>Open the file "CellularOne Outbound MTD.xls"</p>

<p>Filter the table for outbound calls only. Once filtered, copy the entire
    Interaction Duration column.</p>
<img src="images\filter.png" alt="Filter image" width="800">

<p>Paste the copied column in a new sheet. Highlight a cell in the column and insert
    a table.</p>

<p>In column B next to the new table, add the following formula: =A2*1440</p>

<p>Next, either accept the option to use the formula for the length of the column
    or copy the formula the length of the column manually.</p>

<p>Sum column B. The result will be the total number of outbound minutes.</p>

<p>Now copy the total minutes and paste the value into each of the following
    columns: Login Time, Working Time, and Talk Time.</p>

<p>Enter Zero in the Available Time column.</p>

<p>The formula in the Working Rate and Occupancy columns should auto populate.
    If not, manually extend the formula to the outbound and total rows.</p>

<p>Select the Login Time, Working Time, Talk Time, and ACW Time cells of the
    "total" row then click on AutoSum.</p>

<p>Select the Available Time and Handle Time cells of the "total" row then click
    AutoSum.</p>

<p>Extend the Working Rate and Occupancy formulas if you have not already.</p>

<p>Repeat for the same steps for the file "CellularOne Outbound WTD.xls"</p>

<p>Save both files for later use.</p>
