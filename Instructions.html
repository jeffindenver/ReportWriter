            First, you will want to gather all the necessary files. You may download all files from the FTPS site using
            your favorite FTP program.
            FTP: ftps.us.caas.hosted-inin.com

            <p>Folder: ../ScheduledReports/</p>

            <ul>
                <li>CellOne_MTD_QBD.xls</li>
                <li>CellOne_Summary_MTD_QBD.xls</li>
                <li>CellOne_Summary_WTD_QBD.xls</li>
                <li>CellOne_WTD_QBD.xls</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Folder: ../ScheduledReports/Agents/</p>

            <ul style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
                <li>CellularOne Outbound MTD.xls</li>
                <li>CellularOne Outbound WTD.xls</li>
                <li>CellularOne QA MTD.xls</li>
                <li>ThisMonth_C1.xls</li>
                <li>ThisWeek_C1.xls</li>
            </ul>

        </li>
        <li>
            Second, the report requires occupancy numbers for the agents. For this, we use the Efficiency Reporter
            program located at <b>S:\Reports\Utilities\EfficiencyReporter\EfficiencyReporterAuto.jar</b>

            <div class="innerList">

                <p>Double click the jar file to run the program.</p>
                <img src="images\launcher.png" alt="Launcher" height="110" width="591">


                <p>Drag the files ThisMonth_C1.xls and ThisWeek_C1.xls onto the program window. The program will
                    process the files and output efficiency reports, including the occupancy stats. The output file
                    will be written to the same directory from which the files were dragged.</p>
                <img src="images\programWindow.png" alt="Program Window" height="443" width="825">

                <p>Open each of the output files.</p>

                <p>In the agent name column, add rows named "outbound" and "total."</p>

                <p>Open the file "CellularOne Outbound MTD.xls"</p>

                <p>Filter the table for outbound calls only. Once filtered, copy the entire Interaction Duration
                    column.</p>
                <img src="images\filter.png" alt="Filter image" height="785" width="926">

                <p>Paste the copied column in a new sheet. Highlight a cell in the column and insert a table.</p>

                <p>In column B next to the new table, add the following formula: =A2*1440</p>

                <p>Next, either accept the option to use the formula for the length of the column or copy the
                    formula the length of the column manually.</p>

                <p>Sum column B. The result will be the total number of outbound minutes.</p>

                <p>Now copy the total minutes and paste the value into each of the following columns: Login Time,
                    Working Time, and Talk Time.</p>

                <p>Enter Zero in the Available Time column.</p>

                <p>The formula in the Working Rate and Occupancy columns should auto populate. If not, manually
                    extend the formula to the outbound and total rows.</p>

                <p>Select the Login Time, Working Time, Talk Time, and ACW Time cells of the "total" row then click
                    on AutoSum.</p>

                <p>Select the Available Time and Handle Time cells of the "total" row then click AutoSum.</p>

                <p>Extend the Working Rate and Occupancy formulas if you have not already.</p>

                <p>Repeat for the same steps for the file "CellularOne Outbound WTD.xls"</p>

                <p>Save both files for later use.</p>
